    "This is a typical dataset used to demonstrate Machine Learning algorithms in many books and online courses. The set contains Housing prices in California from the 1990s, which makes it kinda dated if you're looking to get actual predictions out of it, but that doesn't mean we can't use it to train models and compare them effectively! \n",

    "This is a key step in any analysis that protects participants from drifting away from the main objective. Many data-scientist fall into this trap when they become more focused on the problem instead of a solution. I know that finding a better way to code functions, trying different algorithms and scaling techniques is fun! But it's an endless rabbit hole. So don't get lost in it, especially if someone is paying you to find a solution for their problem and you have limited time to do that!"
